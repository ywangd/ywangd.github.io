      <description>Introduction The Synod protocol is the centre piece of the Paxos algorithm. The protocol itself is not hard to understand but the proof does take some effort to grasp. In this article, I attempt to explain the proof in a more accessible way. As a consequence of trying to dumb it down, my explanation is not going to be as bullet-proof as in the paper. But hopefully it serves as an easier entrance and stepping stone.</description>
