      <description>I have been using both Sed and Awk in its basic forms for quite sometime without study them systematically. So the understandings were always a bit incomplete and hence inconsistent. So after many years of delay, I finally read the classic book of Sed &amp;amp; Awk.
It is a great read for anyone who is interested in the two tools or just good-old Unix quirks. For an example, name of the grep tool is based on the g/re/p command of the classic ed, or how ed, Vi, and Sed are related to each other (hint: they share similar command pattern).</description>
